# Polynomials

A \\(n-1\\)-degree polynomial is a function of variable \\(x\\) \\(f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + ... + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i\\). In this section we consider polynomials in real numbers, i.e. \\(x \in \mathbb{R}\\) and *coefficients* \\(c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}\\) are also from \\(\mathbb{R}\\) (as we already know complex numbers and addition/multiplication operations with them, we can also consider polynomials in \\(\mathbb{C}\\) - so the notion of polynomial is very general in the sense of underlying domain). Can we represent a polynomial other way?

Consider a line \\(f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x\\) - it is uniquely defined by any 2 *distinct* points (a well-know fact from geometry that only one line goes through 2 points). It turns out that any \\(n-1\\)-degree polynomial is uniquely defined by \\(n\\) *distinct* points  \\((x_0, f(x_0)), (x_1, f(x_1)), ..., (x_{n-1}, f(x_{n-1}))\\). The proof of it will be sketched later in FFT chapter.
