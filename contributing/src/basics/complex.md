# Complex numbers

Before digging into complex numbers, let's disuss a more general idea of *extension* in math. E.g. if we work with natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)[^natural] \\(a, b \in N\\) with addition operation defined (i.e. we get another natural number \\(c = a + b\\)) and we would like to define a subtraction (i.e. \\(c = a - b\\)) then it is not enough to have only natural numbers to deal with situations like \\(3 - 4\\). So we *extend* the set of natural numbers \\(N\\) to integers \\(Z\\).

> We preserved all the elements of the original set \\(N\\) and operations over them (namely, addition), i.e. are preserving the mathematical structure, while introducing new operations on an extended set \\(Z\\) thus allowing us to deal with new situations like \\(3 - 4\\).




[^natural]: There is [an ongoing dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20natural%20numbers,%2C%203%2C%20...%20.) either to include or exclude 0 (usually depends on the application). Here we treat them as values of unsigned integers (focusing on engineering applications).
