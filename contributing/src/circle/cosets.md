# Cosets

Now let's discuss one of the most used data structures in Stwo representing subsets of the circle group - Cosets.
We have to understand them to easily reason about other operations.

First, let's introduce the notion of *subgroup* \\(H\\) of group \\(G\\) - a subset of elements of \\(G\\) which is a group itself under the group operation.

In abstract algebra *coset* is a set which is formed by applying a group operation with respect to some element \\(g \in G\\) to every element of the subgroup \\(h \in H\\).



Exercise: what is a trivial (i.e. the most basic one) coset?
