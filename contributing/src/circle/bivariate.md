# Bivariate polynomials

We work with bivariate polynomials, i.e. polynomials in two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). 
Moreover, these polynomials are defined for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) from our field \\(F\\). 
The usual notation for the set of all such polynomials is \\(F[x, y]\\).
And as we introduce an additional constraint, namely circle group, it means that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) 
are linked by the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). In this case even narrower definition is used: the space of polynomials 
 \\(F[x, y]/(x^2 + y^2 - 1)\\). We should read the notation as the set of all bivariate polynomials 
 where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) belong to the circle group. Also it can be said, polynomials modulo \\(x^2 + y^2 - 1\\).
