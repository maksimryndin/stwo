# Polynomial ring

In the basics chapter we considered polynomials in real values, i.e. \\(x \in \mathbb{R}) and addition/multiplication operations are defined in a familiar way as we think about numbers. But as we already discussed fields and we know that \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is a *field*, what happens when we replace \\(\mathbb{R}\\) with something more exotic like prime integer fields?
